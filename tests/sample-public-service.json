			"description": "This Resource is a third-party assessment service, focused on data security. It is meant to be used by organisations to assist in the carrying out of an assessment of a supplier’s compliance with the ICT security obligations set out by the GDPR. \n\nIn particular, a supplier indicated by the organisation (acting as a processor on behalf of that organisation) will be assessed through a checklist suitably prepared by ICTLC experts in order to verify the compliance of the supplier’s technological infrastructure with the state of the art in terms of security measures to protect company assets, on the fundamental aspects of data protection, and on the organisational security measures regarding the functions of system administrators. \n\nFollowing the results of the supplier assessment, a detailed report summarising the supplier’s status in relation to its obligations under data protection regulations and compliance with international cybersecurity standards, as well as a complete analysis of the supplier’s security risk, will be provided to the organisation.\n",
